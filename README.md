# selected ambient works - pcb
for hack club's solder ysws, i made a pcb inspired by the logo on selected ambient works 85-92, which has a button that turns on lights if the photoresistor thinks it's dark enough!

the circuit is a basic parallel led circuit with a button, with an added pnp that only lets power through if the photoresistor has enough resistance (no light).
